<h1>BEFORE YOU WATCH THAT VIDEO...</h1>
<p>...Just remember how much it hurts your self-esteem.</p>
<p>It's not just one video. You keep scrolling and see content you didn't want to see. Violent content. Remember how it always makes you feel.</p>
<p>Please, remember how much self-hatred it always makes you feel... How much shame.</p>
<p>Guard your eyes, guard your heart, guard your soul. Amen.</p>
